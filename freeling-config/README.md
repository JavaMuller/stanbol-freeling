Freeling Configuration
================

This will hold a default [Freeling](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/) configuration suitable for the Freeling Stanbol integration.

The data within this folder will need to be placed to the $FREELINGSHARD directory. Alternatively you can also explicitly parse the freeling config directory.

The lib directory contains the Java native libs for Linux and MAC. Both ./lib and $FREELINGSHARD/lib are supported as default location. Otherwise you will need to explicitly parse the freeling native lib directory.
